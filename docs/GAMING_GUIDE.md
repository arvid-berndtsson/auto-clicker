## General Best Practices

### Detection Avoidance

1. **Randomization is Key**
   - Always use Random mode or maximum delay variance
   - Never use perfectly consistent timing
   - Vary your patterns between sessions

2. **Human-like Behavior**
   - Take breaks (15 min per hour minimum)
   - Don't run overnight without breaks
   - Vary your play times
   - Mix automated and manual gameplay

3. **Conservative Settings**
   - Longer delays = safer
   - When in doubt, add more randomness
   - Slower is better than faster

4. **Session Management**
   - Limit automation to 2-4 hour sessions
   - Take 10-15 minute breaks regularly
   - Don't automate 24/7
   - Vary your daily patterns

### Technical Tips

1. **Window Management**
   - Keep game window in foreground
   - Don't minimize or switch windows during automation
   - Ensure mouse isn't blocked by other windows

2. **Performance**
   - Close unnecessary programs
   - Monitor CPU/memory usage
   - Reduce game graphics settings if needed
   - Test settings before long sessions

3. **Hotkeys**
   - Always set up stop key (ESC recommended)
   - Test emergency stop before starting
   - Keep hand near stop key during operation
   - Use distinctive keys that won't conflict with game

### Safety Checklist

Before automating, ask yourself:

- [ ] Have I read the game's Terms of Service?
- [ ] Am I prepared for potential account action?
- [ ] Are my delay settings randomized and human-like?
- [ ] Have I tested the stop key?
- [ ] Is this activity low-risk? (no PvP, no competition)
- [ ] Do I have break scheduling enabled?
- [ ] Am I monitoring the automation?
- [ ] Have I considered legitimate alternatives?
